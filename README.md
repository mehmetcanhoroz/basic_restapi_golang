### Hey Mehmet, If you want to try different things or implement complex structure, DON'T USE THIS REPO. IT IS ONLY FOR YOUR BASIC/SMALL PROJECTS. 
### You will need to prepare everything Unless you don't use this repo for complex solutions 
Please Mehmet, don't use. I need to focus basic projects with this repo. You spend more time to prepare architecture than indeed project. So just use this repo and complete the project then get paid.
